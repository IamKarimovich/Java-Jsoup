## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

TurboScraper operates in a few simple steps:

1.  It connects to the main car listings page on `turbo.az`.
2.  It identifies individual car listings on the page.
3.  For each listing, it extracts basic details and then navigates to the car's dedicated product page.
4.  On the product page, it extracts a wealth of detailed specifications.
5.  Finally, all collected data is compiled row-by-row into a new Excel spreadsheet named `product_data.xlsx`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have JDK 8 or higher installed.
* **Maven** (recommended) or **Gradle** for dependency management.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/TurboScraper.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/TurboScraper.git)
    cd TurboScraper
    ```

2.  **Add Dependencies:**

    If using **Maven**, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jsoup</groupId>
            <artifactId>jsoup</artifactId>
            <version>1.17.2</version> </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
            <artifactId>poi</artifactId>
            <version>5.2.5</version> </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
            <artifactId>poi-ooxml</artifactId>
            <version>5.2.5</version> </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```

    (Alternatively, you can manually download the Jsoup and Apache POI JARs and add them to your project's build path.)

### Running the Scraper

1.  **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    javac -cp "path/to/jsoup.jar:path/to/poi.jar:path/to/poi-ooxml.jar" Main.java # Adjust paths as needed
    ```
    Or, if using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

2.  **Run the `Main` class:**
    ```bash
    java -cp ".;path/to/jsoup.jar;path/to/poi.jar;path/to/poi-ooxml.jar" org.example.Main # Windows
    java -cp ".:path/to/jsoup.jar:path/to/poi.jar:path/to/poi-ooxml.jar" org.example.Main # macOS/Linux
    ```
    Or, if using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.Main"
    ```

After successful execution, an Excel file named `product_data.xlsx` will be generated in your project's root directory, containing all the scraped car data.
